											<h3>Understanding Different Types of Income Tax Returns (ITR)</h3>

											<p>Filing income tax returns (ITR) is an important financial responsibility for individuals and businesses alike. It is a way to report your income and expenses to the government, ensuring compliance with tax regulations. However, not all tax returns are the same. The type of ITR you need to file depends on various factors, such as your source of income, the category you fall under, and the nature of your business. In this blog post, we will explore different types of income tax returns to help you understand which one is applicable to you.</p>

											<h3>1. ITR-1 (Sahaj)</h3>
											<p>ITR-1, also known as Sahaj, is the most basic and commonly used form for individuals with income from salary, pension, or one house property. If your total income includes income from other sources such as interest or agricultural income below a specified limit, you can still file ITR-1. However, it is not applicable if you have income from business or profession or if you are a director in a company.</p>
											
											<h3>2. ITR-2</h3>
											<p>ITR-2 is applicable for individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUF) who do not have income from business or profession. It includes individuals with income from more than one house property, capital gains, or foreign assets. If you are a salaried individual with income exceeding the limit of ITR-1 or have capital gains from selling property or shares, ITR-2 is the form for you.</p>
											<h3>3. ITR-3</h3>
											<p>ITR-3 is designed for individuals and HUFs who have income from a proprietary business or are partners in a firm. It applies to individuals and HUFs having income from carrying out a profession, being a consultant, or undertaking any other form of business. If you are a self-employed professional or a partner in a partnership firm, ITR-3 is the appropriate form to file.</p>
											<h3>4. ITR-4 (Sugam)</h3>
											<p>ITR-4, also known as Sugam, is applicable for individuals, HUFs, and firms (other than LLP) who have opted for the presumptive taxation scheme under Section 44AD, Section 44ADA, or Section 44AE of the Income Tax Act. It includes businesses such as small traders, retailers, and professionals whose total turnover or gross receipts do not exceed a certain threshold.</p>
											<h3>5. ITR-5:</h3>
											<p>ITR-5 is applicable for firms, Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs), Association of Persons (AOPs), Body of Individuals (BOIs), and Artificial Juridical Persons (AJPs). It is not meant for individuals or HUFs. If you are a partner in a partnership firm or a member of an LLP, you need to file ITR-5.</p>
											<h3>6. ITR-6</h3>
											<p>ITR-6 is specifically designed for companies that are not claiming exemptions under Section 11 (Income from Property Held for Charitable or Religious Purposes). All companies, except those claiming exemptions under Section 11, need to file ITR-6.</p>
											<h3>7. ITR-7</h3>
											<p>ITR-7 is applicable for individuals, HUFs, companies, and trusts who are required to furnish return under Section 139(4A), Section 139(4B), Section 139(4C), or Section 139(4D) of the Income Tax Act. It includes entities such as charitable trusts, political parties, institutions, and colleges.</p>
											<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
											<p>Understanding the different types of income tax returns (ITR) is crucial to ensure you file the correct form and comply with the tax laws. The appropriate ITR form depends on factors like your source of income, the nature of your business, and the category you fall under. By selecting and</p>
